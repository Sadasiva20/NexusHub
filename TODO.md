# TODO: Modify AI Suggestion Application

## Tasks
- [x] Update API prompt in pages/api/ai.js to return improved code instead of suggestions
- [x] Modify applyAiSuggestion in components/CodeEditor.jsx to replace code with suggestion
- [x] Ensure history and broadcasting are updated correctly
- [ ] Test the changes to ensure applied code runs without issues

## Additional Tasks for Electron and 3D
- [x] Add Electron dependencies and scripts to package.json
- [x] Create main.js for Electron main process
- [x] Add Three.js dependency
- [x] Create ThreeScene component for 3D visualization

## Notes
- Current behavior appends suggestion text, which disrupts code
- New behavior replaces code with improved version for minimal disruption
- AI prompt needs to generate runnable code
- Electron setup allows running as desktop app
- Three.js component provides basic 3D scene
